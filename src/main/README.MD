Java Developer Assignment - Library Management System
We would like you to build a Library Management System that allows users to manage
books and borrowers. The system should be built using Java and should include the
following features:</p>

## FEATURES
 1. A Book class that includes the following attributes:
   • Title (String)
   • Author (String)
   • ISBN (String)
   • Available Copies (int)
2. A Borrower class that includes the following attributes:
   • Name (String)
   • Email (String)
   • Phone Number (String)
3. A ManagementSystem class that manages a list of books and borrowers and includes
   the following methods:
   • addBook: Adds a new book to the list of books
   • removeBook: Removes a book from the list of books
   • getBook: Returns a book based on its ISBN
   • borrowBook: Updates the available copies of a book when it is borrowed by a
   borrower
   • returnBook: Updates the available copies of a book when it is returned by a  
   borrower
   • addBorrower: Adds a new borrower to the list of borrowers
   • removeBorrower: Removes a borrower from the list of borrowers
   • getBorrower: Returns a borrower based on their email
4. The system should use a database to store the books and borrowers. You should use
   JDBC to connect to the database.
5. The system should expose a REST API to allow users to interact with the system over
   the web.
   You are free to design the user interface in any way you see fit, but it should be easy to use
   and understand.
   Requirements
6. The code should be written in Java
7. You should use an Object-Oriented approach to design the classes and methods
8. You should use the Singleton and Factory design patterns in your code
9. You should use JDBC to connect to the database and perform database operations
10. You should use Spring Boot to expose a REST API
11. The code should be well-documented and easy to understand
    Evaluation Criteria
    We will evaluate the following criteria when reviewing your code:
12. Correctness: Does the program meet the requirements and work as expected?
13. Design: Is the code well-designed and easy to understand?
14. Code Quality: Is the code clean and maintainable? Are best practices followed?
15. Documentation: Is the code well-documented and easy to understand?
    Submission
    Please submit your code in a GitHub repository and provide us with a link to the repository.
    In addition, please provide a README file that includes instructions on how to build and run
    the program, as well as any assumptions you made or design decisions you would like to
    highlight.
